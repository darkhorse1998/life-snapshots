I have realized that in this tech savvy world, one has to continuously keep the learning curve on the move. I want to place myself in an environment where I have to face meaningful challenges, within say, 3% outside my comfort zone or current capabilities, every now and then. This would help me keep up the pace, learn continuously and help the organization progress as well.

Being a personal finance enthusiast, I believe that most of the events in life can be planned and mapped. It's not that everything in life would be going according to the plan (wish that was the case; but life would have been significantly boring then). However, when we have our plans made; actions mapped, we get a sense of direction towards our goals and milestones in life. We are then able to construct systems for our selves and work towards it.

* Reading: Here are few books I have read: https://darkhorse1998.github.io/m2m/BooksCorner.html
* Reviewing my finances: I spend a good deal of time during weekends or holidays, studying about businesses, reviewing progress of my financial plan and asset allocation, documenting and book-keeping of my investments and listening to mentors I follow.
* Learning/Creating something new: I do spend some of my time doing courses, implementing stuff. In fact, I have started a Make&Learn initiative for myself, where I tend to create something useful while learning about it. An example would be my very portfolio here: https://darkhorse1998.github.io/portfolio/

## Version 1.0
Data Science Enthusiast | NLP | Innovator | Fast Learner

Highly enthusiastic for Data Analytics, Data Mining and Data Science.I have always been into exploring various career fields and I am glad that I got a surplus period of 4 years allotted for it because of Engineering. I dived into many domains but Data Science and Artificial Intelligence were the two most appealing domains for me. Hence, I have decided to take them as my career path.

After enrolling into various courses, tutorials and workshops, it was clear to me that simply doing few courses and getting some certifications won't make me a Data Scientist. For a Data Scientist, it's very important to gain exposure and hands-on experience. Hence, I started enrolling into several projects and competitions.

* Edulyt India : Data Analytics Intern
This was a wonderful journey for me as I got to deal with various real life customer data. Packed with drawing insights and figuring out anomalies with extensive Exploratory Data Analysis, this internship helped me view data science from a new perspective.

* Spotle.ai
Really proud to a part of the Spotle.ai family. After completion of two projects on Covid-19 and receiving adept remarks on them, I got selected for the Forecasting Bengal Elections Competition which is about to start.

* IBM Hack Challenge 2020
Being a fast learner, this ongoing challenge proves to be a really challenging one as I am quite new to using IBM Cloud Services. But, getting hands-on experience on IBM Watson is truly worth all the sweat. Dealing with Covid-19 Twitter Data Sentiment analysis for this challenge.

The real insights and hidden facts behind data could only be found in the real-life data. Hence, I am looking forward to engaging myself more into such jobs, projects or internships.
